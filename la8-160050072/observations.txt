Comparision among different initialization methods
=======================================================
A. It can be seen among the 3 initializations, random initializations performs the worst, 
   as it takes 60+ iterations to converge and the converged value is a local minima(~1000) 
   which is much higher than for the other two methods. 
   The nearest neighbour performs much better (converges in about 16 iterations) and converges
   to about 700 local minima. Wherehas, the euclidean tour took (also converges in about 16
    iterations) and converges to around 700. But the convergence point for the nearest 
    neighbour seems to be highle dependent on the initial city taken.

    Considering all the above observations, I think euclidean tour is the best initialization
    becuase it has the guarantee to be close to the true solution(unlike random 
    initialization) and is also easier to compute(unlike nearest neighbour initialization). 

    It(euclidean initialization) possibly also doesn't depend much on the 
    initial choice of the city. 

    Hence euclidean tour initialization is most recommended. 


Comparing

Task 2 and Task 6
========================================================
Q. How does 2-3 opt neighbours fare wrt 2opt neighbours in random initialization

A. 2-3 opt converges faster. Using 2opt neighbours we see the convergence in about 70 
iterations where as, for using 2+3 opt neighbours, we can see convergence in about 45 
iterations. The values of convergence are almost the same for both the neighbour hood
generating algorithms. Hence, becuase of faster convergence I think 2+3 opt neigbours 
is a better neighbour hood generating algorithm. This is to be expected as there are 
more transformations of the tour availiable in 2+3opt method, it performs a steeper 
descent to the minima than 2opt method.


Task 3 and Task 7 
======================================================== 
Q. How does 2-3 opt neighbours fare wrt 2opt neighbours in nearest neighbour initialization.
A. Comparing both plots( task 3 and task7), we see that 2+3 neighourhood(about 10 iters) 
converges faster than 2opt neighbours(about 17 iters). The converged values also appear to 
be smaller for 2+3 opt compared to 2opt neighbour method. The convergence is steeper in 
case of 2+3opt neighbour hood when compared to the 2opt neighbour hood.

Hence, I think 2+3opt neighbourhood generation is better than 2opt method. This is to 
be expected as the 2+3opt neighbourhood include more possiblities(steeper) of descent
to the local minima. Hence, the observed smaller number of iterations required. The values
of converges are closeby however.  



Task 4 and Task 8
======================================================== 
Q. How does 2-3 opt neighbours fare wrt 2opt neighbours in Euclidean tour initialization ?
A. Comparing both plots( task 4 and task8), we see that 2+3 neighourhood(about 16 iters) 
converges is almost same as 2opt neighbours(about 16 iters). The converged values for 2+3 opt are very much same as that of 2opt neighbour method. 

Hence, for euclidean initialization, I think 2+3 opt neighbourhood generation is just as good 
as 2opt method. This is perhaps the initialization itself is good enough, the decent doesn't 
need much modifications hence 2opt neighbours alone suffice. Since, 2opt neighbours are 
easiers to compute, complexity wise 2opt neighbour method is better as it is giving the same 
results faster. 



=========================================================================================== 

It can hence be seen that choosing neighbours generation algorithm appropriately, we can
reach the minima in much faster iteration although the point itself may not change very
much. Choosing the initialization properly will result in a good estimate of the global 
minima.
