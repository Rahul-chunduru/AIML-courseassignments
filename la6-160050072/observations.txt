Observations about plot.png
=====================================================
1. It can be seen that the number of actions decreases with increase in determinism in 
   the state transitions and the agent choices, overall, which is to be expected as 
   with smaller p it makes a random choice and hence is expected to perform worse than
   an agent who takes an informed choice.

2. The graph obtained isn't strictly decreasing with increase in determinism, p.
   Probably, because, for the 10 x 10 graph, the random picking for smaller p took a 'better' 
   choice of moves than for larger p. 

   We would however, need to run the code with different seeds and graphs to truly comment on 
   true dependence of no. of actions with p, although, it can be expected to be decreasing. 
   As, with increase in p, the agent takes a more informed action.

Observations about path.png
=====================================================
1. The path taken by the agent isn't a straight line, i.e, the agent explored different 
   actions around the actual path, hence we get a route spread over the optimal path.

2. The path has been observed with varing p, with smaller p, the spread around the 
   optimal path is more. 

   p determines the determinism of the agent. The higher the indeterminism in the agent
   and the world, the harder and insensible is the "optimal" choice.
