No major reference has been used while coming up with this code. 
Stack overflow has been referenced for performing transpose and multiplication on numpy arrays.

The code isn't optimal, in the sense it uses a lot of for loops wherehas better implementation constructs might exist.

The algorithm for performing forwardpass and backwardpass is my own. 

While coming up with models, especially for task 2.4,
I have discussed with my collegues about possible models that could be used.

However, I  came up wiht the final model which I trained and submitted (1 convolution layer and (36,18,10) fully connected 
layer) without anyone's help.
